# Smart-Home-Automation
To design and implement a smart home system using an ATmega32 microcontroller to automate lighting and fan speed based on environmental conditions. It includes an LM35 temperature sensor, LDR, flame sensor, PWM-controlled motor, LCD for real-time display, and an H-bridge for fan control. LEDs indicate light intensity levels.
Project Overview: This project involves developing a smart home system that adjusts lighting, fan speed, and safety alerts based on environmental conditions:
1. Lighting Control: The LDR detects ambient light intensity and controls three LEDs to indicate different levels of light.
2. Fan Speed Control: The LM35 temperature sensor adjusts the fan speed proportionally to the room temperature.
3. Fire Detection: A flame sensor detects fire, triggers an alarm, and displays a critical alert on the LCD.
4. LCD Display: Shows real-time temperature readings, fan status, light intensity, and alerts.
