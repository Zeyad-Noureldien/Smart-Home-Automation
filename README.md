# Smart-Home-Automation
To design and implement a smart home system using an ATmega32 microcontroller to automate lighting and fan speed based on environmental conditions. It includes an LM35 temperature sensor, LDR, flame sensor, PWM-controlled motor, LCD for real-time display, and an H-bridge for fan control. LEDs indicate light intensity levels.
