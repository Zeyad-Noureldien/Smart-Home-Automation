**This project is a smart home automation system using an ATmega32 microcontroller. It controls lighting and fan speed based on environmental conditions and includes a fire detection system for safety.**

**Features**

1) Automatic Lighting Control using an LDR sensor and LEDs.

2) Fan Speed Control using an LM35 temperature sensor and PWM.

3) Fire Detection System using a flame sensor and buzzer alert.

4) LCD Display showing real-time system status.

**Hardware Components**

Microcontroller: ATmega32

Sensors: LM35 (temperature), LDR (light), Flame sensor

Actuators: LEDs, Fan motor (controlled via H-Bridge), Buzzer

Display: 16x2 LCD
